- 👋 Hi, I’m @r-dug

- 👀 I’m interested in... well, I'm still a novice. I got into coding because I was interested in Algo Trading though!
  I think maching learning will unlock a lot of potential for the individual. I think decentralized finance and cryptocurrencies will be a great democratizer.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I possibly can. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
  -Discussions surrounding the potential of the DeFi space- what benefits are yet to be unlocked, and what can we do about that?
  -An app that notifies its user when good buy or sell opportunities are present for assets they are invested in.
